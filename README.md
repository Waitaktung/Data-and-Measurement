# Ethical Concerns of using Predictive Policing Softwares, Course work in University of Mannheim (2019, Autumn) 

Keywords: Predictive Analytics, Privacy Intrusion, Racism and Transparency

This literature review attempted to present how predictive policing software and the subsequent ethical concerns of its use are conceptualised by interdisciplinary academics. 
Three major ethical problems were discussed in this literature view, namely, privacy intrusion, racial discrimination and low police accountability due to low transparency of the 
predictive softwares. From a jurisprudence perspective, the literatures were certain about the use of predictive policing software would intrude an individualâ€™s privacy. The 
review however showed that claims about predictive policing software caused racial profiling and increase the transparency of the softwares. This review also reflected that due to 
methodological difficulties, it would be difficult to conduct further quantitative empirical studies to improve the situation. It is hoped that this literature review not only 
give an overview of predictive policing software to the readers, but more importantly to encourage academics and the public to scrutinize the potential ethical problems behind the 
use of predictive policing software.
